# The GitHub Markdown syntax for alerts sucks

<datetime :date="$frontmatter.publishedAt" formatter="longdate"/>

The new [GitHub alerts blocks](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-12-14-new-markdown-extension-alerts-provide-distinctive-styling-for-significant-content/) are visually clean and useful. I was never a fan of the confusing syntaxes (plural because it changed a couple of times) but I can live with it **inside GitHub**. Then it [landed in Vitepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#100-rc40-2024-1-22), which made me think about it.

Now [I think it sucks](../articles/github-alerts-markdown-syntax.md), and we are legion.
