excerpt: I usually associate pixel art with videogames from the SNES and [GBA](https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/09/upcoming-book-celebrates-the-pixel-art-of-the-gba) era. And [now with Mac OS]().

# The “Macintosh” wallpaper of macOS Sequoia

<datetime :date="$frontmatter.publishedAt" formatter="longdate"/>

Apple has this tradition of adding new wallpapers to major macOS versions. I just updated to [macOS Sequoia](https://www.apple.com/macos/macos-sequoia), which comes with a [lovely “Macintosh” wallpaper](https://basicappleguy.com/haberdashery/macintoshwallpapers) showcasing the [pixelated and monochrome era of Mac OS](https://infinitemac.org/), but with hues of colors changing dynamically during the day.

That’s so cool! I usually rely on [Umbra](https://replay.software/umbra) to set wallpapers, but I think I’ll stick for a while with this new Macintosh one.
