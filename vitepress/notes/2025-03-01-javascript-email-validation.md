# Validating an email using the web platform

<datetime :date="$frontmatter.publishedAt" formatter="longdate"/>

I saw a [post about an email utility class](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anthony-cyrille_design-tip-nutilisez-plus-de-classe-utilitaires-activity-7300031767225208833-i5Xw) on LinkedBin (don’t judge me), which triggered me to tinker around this. It turns out there’s a lot we can enable with only a few lines of code. I’m rather happy with the end result, so I packaged it while on it. [Let’s break the code down](../articles/javascript-email-validation.md).

The most amazing thing is still that it all started on LinkedBin, the place where humanity ends.
