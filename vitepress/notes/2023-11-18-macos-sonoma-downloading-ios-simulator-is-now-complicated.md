The only benefit of having a bandwidth that sucks (thanks Proximus, everyone hates you!) is that you can experience the suffering of your end users before they do, and observe how a ton of websites behave in sub-optimal situations, so that you can learn a bit about web performance and consider [what makes sense for your website](https://adamsilver.io/blog/in-defence-of-graceful-degradation-and-where-progressive-enhancement-comes-in/).

Thatâ€™s it, everything else sucks. Now, [even downloading the iOS Simulator needs a PhD](../articles/macos-sonoma-download-xcode-simulators-slow-bandwidth.md).
