excerpt: You can ask me anything about [tech](https://github.com/meduzen/ask/discussions/categories/tech) ([or non-tech](https://github.com/meduzen/ask/discussions/categories/things-unrelated-to-tech)) stuff using GitHub discussions, or emails. Let’s say [it’s an experiment]().

# Ask me anything

<datetime :date="$frontmatter.publishedAt" formatter="longdate"/>

This year at work has mostly been about supporting other teams, and with time I’ve been asked questions going beyond the scope of my role. Since I’m about to switch job, maybe it’s a good moment to try running a “ask me anything” space. I’m very much okay if this goes nowhere.

The space for this is [a repository](https://github.com/meduzen/ask) where you can ask me anything that is [technical](https://github.com/meduzen/ask/discussions/categories/tech) ([or not](https://github.com/meduzen/ask/discussions/categories/things-unrelated-to-tech)). If you don’t use GitHub, it’s also possible to [send me an email](https://mehdi.cc#contact).
