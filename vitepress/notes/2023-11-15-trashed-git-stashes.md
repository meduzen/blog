# Lost git stashes

<datetime :date="$frontmatter.publishedAt" formatter="longdate"/>

[Git stashes](https://css-irl.info/how-git-stash-can-help-you-juggle-multiple-branches) are basically drafts for future commits, and also one of my favorite features: they allow to **keep non-committed code on the side** and bring the changes back later. I use them a lot while working on my personal code.

Years ago (and a couple of years later ðŸ˜‘), stupid me lost the stashes of a project, and gathering all informations to bring them back properly was no easy task, so I [wrote about recovering them](../articles/recover-a-lost-git-stash.md). Drafts are important in mostly every app, and git is no exception.
