# Nice URLs

2023-11-10

It blown my mind when I discovered [URL rewriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_engine) 15 years ago, thanks to Wordpress that has a setting for URLs structure in its admin panel. Before that, a lot of URLs of the internet ended by a file extension like `.html`, `.php`, `.asp`â€¦

A decent URL is one that humans can read. My first article on this blog is about [having a decent Nginx configuration for URLs on this blog powered by Vitepress](../articles/using-vitepress-cleanurls-on-nginx-environment.md).
