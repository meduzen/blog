# Nice URLs

2023-11-10

It blown my mind when I discovered [URL rewriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_engine) 15 years ago. It was probably in the [permalink setting](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/customize-permalinks/#choosing-your-permalink-structure) of a Wordpress admin panel. Back then, a lot of URLs of the internet ended by a file extension like `.html`, `.php` or `.asp`â€¦

A decent URL is one that humans can read. It hints the page purpose and reflects the information architecture. My first article on this blog tells how to [configure Nginx to have nice URLs on a blog powered by Vitepress](../articles/vitepress-cleanurls-on-nginx-environment.md).
