# Better late then never

2023-10-20

I’m happy I found [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev) to support this place, it will do the job for now. It’s been half-a-decade since I wanted to write and share about web stuff (mainly development), so here I am.

Things I need to do at some point:
- add RSS feed(s);
- do some front-end stuff for convenience, including a custom theme;
- ~~remember the fourth item of that list~~ see how to connect the notes to the Fediverse.

Anyway, today is the release date of the Nintendo Switch [_Super Mario Wonder_](https://supermariobroswonder.nintendo.com/) videogame, and Nintendo has [clearly been](https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-11-super-mario-bros-wonder-part-1/) high on drugs for this one.
