# About

This blog is powered by [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/), with a very small number of changes to handle index pages. The [code](https://github.com/meduzen/blog) is open source, and in no way represent the any extent of my front-end skills.

I have no idea how I’ll tweak it in the future. For now it doesn’t really feel personal, but even [my personal page](https://mehdi.cc) doesn’t.
