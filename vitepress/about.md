# About

Hi, I’m [Mehdi Merah](https://mehdi.cc), and this is my blog about web stuff. I have no idea how I’ll tweak it in the future. For now it doesn’t really feel personal, but even [my personal page](https://mehdi.cc) doesn’t.

It is powered by [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/), with a very small number of changes. The [code](https://github.com/meduzen/blog) is open source.

## Feeds

You can subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml). It contains the whole content of all articles and notes. Let me know ([email](https://mehdi.cc#contact) or [GitHub issue](https://github.com/meduzen/blog/issues/3)) if you’re interested in a lighter feed!
