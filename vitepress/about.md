# About

Hi, I’m [Mehdi Merah](https://mehdi.cc), and this is my blog about web stuff. I have no idea how I’ll tweak it in the future. For now it doesn’t really feel personal, but even [my personal page](https://mehdi.cc) doesn’t.

It is powered by [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/), with a very small number of changes. The [code](https://github.com/meduzen/blog) is open source.

## Feeds

I have RSS feeds for all kind of deviances and tastes.

- [All content](/feed.xml) contains both articles and notes, without content cut.
- [Notes only](/feed-notes-only.xml) to binge-read small content.
- [Articles only](/feed-articles-only.xml) for the headache-afficionados readers.
- [Articles excerpts](/feed-articles-excerpts-only.xml) for the procrastinators.
- [Articles excerpts and full notes](/feed-articles-excerpts-and-notes.xml) for… the others, I guess.

Due to this space being recent, there’s currently no limit in the amount of items in each feed.

For any RSS issue or suggestion, [send me an email](https://mehdi.cc#contact) or [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/meduzen/blog/issues/3).
